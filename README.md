This is a fork of Farhan's sBitx reference implementation software with minimal changes, just enough to make it compile and run fine on recent Linux and Raspberry Pi versions.

Use this fork with a recent WiringPi version for Raspberry Pi 5 support: https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi/releases

Install instructions are in [install.txt](install.txt) file.

For a simple I/O-only (no DSP) software for sBitx, use: https://github.com/Rhizomatica/sbitx-core

For a stable and sane headless sBitx software implementation, look at: https://github.com/Rhizomatica/hermes-net/tree/main/trx_v2-userland
